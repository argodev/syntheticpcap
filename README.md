# Synthetic PCAP Generator
Simple tool to generate synthetic PCAP data for testing purposes


In its current incarnation, this tool doesn't generate particularly interesting
packets/traffic, but it does allow you to generated a reasonably high volume 
of packets in case you are trying to load/stress test your abiity to handle
packet volume/parsing rates.

It generates completely random MAC addresses and IP addresses. Any similarities
between the addresses generated and real-life are completely conincidental.
